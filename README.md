# JAGS-Bayesian-hierarchical-model
 
#### This Machine Learning Model is developed using R is used for predicting the rate of infant mortality of a region, based on the several factors present in the dataset. Income, region, oil-producing continents are some of the several factors which affect the rate of infant mortality and our model is using those factors as a whole, while accounting the individual traits of each factor present in the Dataset.

### This Model was developed using JAGS Library; while MCMC Algorithmic chains were used for helping the model converge.
